_A website where the user can select the type of pizza they'd like to order. Price is calculated depending on the size and number of toppings selected._

Pricing for base pizza is as follows:
* _Small - $7.00_
* _Medium - $10.00_
* _Large - $13.00_
* _X-Large - $15.00_

Each additional topping will add $0.50 to total price.
